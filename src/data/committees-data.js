export const UNCSW =
  'In the wake of progress around the globe, it is necessary to ensure that all citizens march at the same pace. The UN-CSW committee is the one that promotes gender equality and checks on women empowerment. In countries where traditions promote discrimination, this committee takes care of women’s rights. Traditionally it was established to put an end to the prevalent discrimination in many nations in the name of religious laws. But, with as the time progressed, the agendas of CSW became more broad and focused also on developing ecosystems that not only gives equal rights to both genders, but also offers them opportunities to exploit their rights equally. The simulation of CSW committee at JECRC MUN has so far explored the challenging notions of role of men and boys in gender equality, the need for women empowerment, and many such. This edition’s agenda aims at establishing checks and measures against the allowances being made for women, so that the rules don’t become unfair to the male gender. Also, the main aim is not bringing women forward, rather having them come at par with men. This is to be achieved not by force or farce, but with the help of fair resources and infrastructures. JECRC MUN 2020 is simulating the ideal committee for feminists and gender equality volunteers who can get a stage to talk about the change they wish to see.'

export const WHO =
  'The WHO is an agency of United Nations entrusted with the responsibility to maintain international public health. It monitors the standards of health and living as per the global population and directs programs to help nations strengthen their healthcare services. Many countries have not been able to support its citizens and offer healthcare as one of the basic amenities of life. WHO attempts to bridge this gap between the developed nations and third-world countries! Amidst the current crisis the world is facing with outbreaks of several communicable diseases in various parts of world, the WHO has to work with more conviction. Also, one part of the world is under the impact of severe malnutrition and under-nourishment of its population, while another is struggling with obesity. All these uneven conditions make the work of WHO, all the more challenging. Medication, population control, access to safe living conditions, and pollution are some of the prime concerns of this face of United Nations at the moment. However, this is the beginning of simulation of World Health Organization as a committee at JECRC MUN. In current scenario, it is impossible to ignore the health repercussions and how a country chooses to ensure the well-being of its residents. Also, since globalization is trending, it is the moral duty of any country to help another wage a war against the diseases crippling the population. Thus, the agenda of WHO deals with the crisis world faced during the outbreak of Ebola virus in Africa.'
